/**
 * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
 *
 * Some properties:
 * - If the array contains all non-negative numbers. The sum is equal to the entire array.
 * - If the array contains all negative numbers. The sum is equal to the smallest number, or an empty array if permitted.
 * - It is possible that several sub arrays have the same maximum sum.
 *
 * - Initially we could do this by creating every possible subarray and compare all of these subarrays (brute force). but this is O(nÂ²) AKA slow.
 * - A faster way is to use [KADANE'S ALGORITHM]. (Great resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CQq3pKSUw)
 * - Another solution would be to reduce using shortest path algo.
 *
 * Quick explanation of Kadane's algorithm:
 * We only compare the max of all previous elements + current element and the current element.
 * If the previous elements + current elements is larger than the current element, this is the new sum. otherwise the current element is the new max/sum.
 *
 *
 * example: arr=[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2]
 * first iteration:
 *      sum = -2
 *      max = -2
 *
 *      sum = max(-2,1, 1) = 1
 *      max = max(-2,1) = 1     => new max is 1
 *
 *      The following iteration we only compare this max + current element with the current element.

/** Recursive (divide and conquer solution)
 * Great resource for recursive solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBCzO0FpsVc
 * We divide the array in 2 parts (line in the middle)
 * This results in 3 possible cases:
 *  - The subset is on the left of the line => recursive call
 *  - The subset is on the right of the line => recursive call
 *  - The subset is crossing the line.
 *
 *  We take the max of these 3 cases.
 *
 *  Divide and conquer:
 *  - A basic return, that ends the recursion => when there is only 1 element left.
 *  - 2 recursive solutions (based on the cases above)
